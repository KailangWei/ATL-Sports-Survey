# ATL-Sports-Survey
Data analytics on Atlanta Sports Survey data including many topics like social media, fandom base, stadium, fans profile etc.

1. Segmentation Studies
•	The survey includes multiple questions related to demographics and behaviors.  Groups may profile the best (and worst) segments of customers for each team.  Think in terms of marketing – where do teams have strengths and where do teams struggle?  
2. Brand Image and Behavioral Studies
•	The survey provides data on several attitudinal and behavioral measures.  Groups may study the variation in attitudes and behaviors across the local teams.  For example, the survey asks respondents to describe the teams with descriptors such as “excitement”, “fun” or “passionate”, etc.   How do the teams compare across these brand dimensions?  Groups may also attempt to relate the “attitudes” to higher-level indicators of fandom such as purchasing. 
3. Fandom Drivers and Deterrents
•	What are the drivers or deterrents to fandom in general or for specific teams?  For example, question 28 asks about how a variety of factors influences fandom.  What are the key factors?  Do these factors vary across teams?  Do these factors vary across segments?  
4. Special Topics
•	This year’s survey includes questions about “not in seats” fan activities, gambling, esports and sustainability.  I encourage groups to investigate these special topics.
